**CFU**: 6.

**Aims**:  understand the Bayesian inferential paradigm and its difference with respect to classical inferential paradigm. Being able to specify and estimate a range of models within the Bayesian approaches, assess the quality of the models and interpret the results.

**Content**:Introduction to Bayesian inference (with refresh of probability calculus and likelihood inference), Single parameter models: binomial, normal, Poisson
Bayesian estimate, credibility interval (HPD), Predictive distribution (PPP), exchangeability Non informative/ weak informative / reference prior, Multiparameter models: multivariate normal, known and unknown, variance Asymptotic approximation (parallel with classical inference), Hierarchical models, Regression model MCMC general introduction (Gibbs-Metropolis), Programming an MCMC algorithm in R, Introduction to Stan and use of Stan for estimation,  (optional) sketch of other approximation methods (Laplace, INLA); model selection and averaging.
