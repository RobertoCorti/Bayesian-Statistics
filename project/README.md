# Bayesian Statistics exam - Bayesian hierarchical model for football results



## Introduction

Being one of the most popular sports in the world, in recent years football data analysis has become an interesting field of study. The aim of this project is to replicate the work of Baio, G., Blangiardo, M. (2010), that propose a Bayesian model for modeling the number of goals scored during a football match. In order to compare the results with the ones of this work, all the analysis has been conducted by using the data about the Italian Serie A championship 1991-1992.
